/*
Ships should have a method to battle other ships: ship.battle(otherShip) -
should return true if the actual ship (this) wins
the ship should win if its calculated score is higher
- calculate score: Number of Alive pirates in the crew - Number of consumed rum by the captain
The loser crew has a random number of losses (deaths). - The winner captain and crew has a party, including a random number of rum :)
