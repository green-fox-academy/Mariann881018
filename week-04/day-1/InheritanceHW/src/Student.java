methods:
 - getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
 - introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."
 - skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
The Student class has the following constructors:
