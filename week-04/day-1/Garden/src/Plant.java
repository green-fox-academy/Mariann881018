/*
The Garden
   is able to hold unlimited amount of flowers or trees
   when watering it should only water those what needs water with equally divided amount amongst them
   eg. watering with 40 and 4 of them need water then each gets watered with 10

The Flower
   needs water if its current water amount is less then 5
   when watering it the flower can only absorb the 75% of the water
   eg. watering with 10 the flower's amount of water should only increase with 7.5

The Tree
   needs water if its current water amount is less then 10
   when watering it the tree can only absorb the 40% of the water
   eg. watering with 10 the tree's amount of water should only increase with 4
