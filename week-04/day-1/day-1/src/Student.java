/*
Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional
fields:
 - previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
 - skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course

The Student class has the following constructors:
 - Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
  Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0

methods:
 - getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
 - introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."
 - skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
